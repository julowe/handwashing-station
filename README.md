# Public Handwashing Station

Code for Seattle Makers Handwashing Station - for microcontroller and case .scad files

[Online document of details of project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-PBiPL9ZbdBNWGurX_gGqHYQGLAaOwbc2duFg0iOV-k/edit?usp=sharing) lives here, with permissions that anyone can comment. [gDrive folder with many files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-24RShQuXvstHFheTFkZpZMX1k5Q41IC?usp=sharing) is here and viewable by public.

## Case Files

Iteration with handle attached to bottom box part uploaded here, STLs and the 3mf files to save the print settings. I forget and can't find where I got the case files from, I believe from thingiverse and I have some memory of changing the parameters in Fusion? Will update that soon hopefully.

`handle.scad` and its output `handle.stl` are my hack to make it possible to fit this box in to the opening of the handwashing station while still, you know, actually holding the box...

Print 1 `box-Bottom-lanyard-4.3mf` (which is a combination of `box-Bottom-lanyard-4.stl` and `handle.stl`), 1 of `box-Top4.3mf`, 1 of `box-Seal4-20220811.3mf`, and 1 of `box-connectors.3mf` (which contains 2 of `hinge.stl`, 2 of `latch_arm_latch_arm_v1.stl`, and 2 of `latch_cam_latch_cam_v1.stl`) 


## Code

Simple on-off, wait, on-off with pump after button press. I did not write this code, just archiving here. Alas, I'm not sure right now if this is the most up to date code, will check next time I am in space.
