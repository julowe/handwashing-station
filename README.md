Code for Seattle Makers Handwashing Station - for microcontroller and case .scad files

[Online document of details of project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-PBiPL9ZbdBNWGurX_gGqHYQGLAaOwbc2duFg0iOV-k/edit?usp=sharing) lives here, with permissions that anyone can comment.

## Case Files

Current iteration uploaded here, STLs and the 3mf files to save the print settings. I forget and can't find where I got the case files from, I believe from thingiverse and I have some memory of changing the parameters in Fusion? Will update that soon hopefully.

## Code

Simple on-off, wait, on-off with pump after button press. I did not write this code, just archiving here.
